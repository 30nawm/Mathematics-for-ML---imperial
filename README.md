## 🧮 Mathematics for Machine Learning (Imperial College London)

This repository contains my personal learning notebooks and exercises from the **“Mathematics for Machine Learning”** specialization offered by **Imperial College London** on **Coursera**.

The goal of this project is to **build a solid mathematical foundation** for understanding and developing modern **machine learning algorithms**.
Each notebook includes theoretical explanations, code implementations, and visual demonstrations of key mathematical ideas that underpin ML.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* Strengthen intuition behind **Linear Algebra**, **Multivariate Calculus**, and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.
* Understand how these mathematical tools directly apply to **machine learning algorithms**.
* Develop reproducible, well-documented Jupyter notebooks for **study**, **revision**, and **sharing knowledge** with other learners.
